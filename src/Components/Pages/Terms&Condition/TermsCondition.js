                        Services. Therefore, you are recommended carefully
                        consider whether such use is suitable for you in terms

                        The risk of loss in holding any cryptocurrencies can be
                        substantial. You should therefore carefully consider
                        whether holding any crypto tokens is suitable for you in
                        light of your financial condition. In considering
                        whether to hold any crypto tokens, you should be aware
                        that the price or value of cryptocurrencies can change
                        rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero.
                        Tokens or any cryptocurrencies are not issued by any
                        central banks or national, supra-national, or
                        quasi-national organizations. They are also not backed
                        by any hard assets or other credit. The value of tokens
                        or any cryptocurrencies is affected by several factors,
                        including but not limited to, the total number of tokens
                        or any cryptocurrencies in existence, the continued
                        willingness of market participants to exchange
                        government-issued currency for tokens or
                        cryptocurrencies , purchasers' expectations with respect
                        to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies, purchasers'
                        expectations with respect to the rate of deflation of
                        cryptocurrencies, interest rates, currency exchange
                        rates, cyber theft of cryptocurrencies from online
                        cryptowallet providers, or news of such theft from such
                        providers or individuals' cryptowallets, investment and
                        trading activities of large investors, monetary policies
                        of the governments, trade restrictions, currency
                        devaluations and revaluations, regulatory measures, the
                        global or regional political, economic or financial
                        events and situations. Thus, all these factors will
                        affect the value of tokens or cryptocurrencies, which
                        may result in the permanent partial or total loss of the
                        value of the Company, a particular tokens or
                        cryptocurrency. No one will be obliged to guarantee the

                        or crypto currencies maintained into your Wallets. The
                        volatility and unpredictability of the value of tokens
                        or cryptocurrencies relative to the government-issued
                        currency may result in a significant loss over a short
